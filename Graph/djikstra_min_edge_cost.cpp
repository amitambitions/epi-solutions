/*
	Given a weighted graph that can be either cyclic/acyclic and directed/undirected. 
	Given a starting and target node, find the min cost path with min number of edges.
	
	Input : Graph g
	Output: min cost 
	
	Solution:
		We can use Djikstra's shortest path algorithm with some modifications.
		For comparing the cost we can include no. of edges also.
