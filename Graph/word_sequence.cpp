	Given a dictionary of words, starting string 's' and target string 't', check if there is 
	a sequence of words which starts with 's' and ends with 't'. The condition is that each
	adjacent word should differ only in one position and all the words in the sequence should 
	be of same length. Return the smallest sequence length if there are many, else return -1.
	
	Input: Dictionary of string, s, t
	Output: Return the smallest sequence length if there are many, else return -1
